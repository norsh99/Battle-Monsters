# Battle-Monsters
A deep dive into a top down turn based strategy game with customizable battle monsters.

TLDR:

Build an Ability System Similar to Pokemon Duel
-Duel features many characters and endless amounts of customization to make each character unique. I set out to replicate that system.

Scriptable Objects
-Unity has a feature called Scriptable Objects that you can use to extend your classes. This enables you to create new objects and edit their fields in the inspector. You can then  drag and drop those objects whenever needed. This is how you can create Abilities.

Extending Abilities
-By further extending Scriptable Objects you can create a custom class with override methods to go completely custom in the code.
